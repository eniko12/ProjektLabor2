## Requested business model

- Customers must have an internet connection in order to connect to the website and use it without any disruption.

- Being a registered user is not neccesary for online purchases.

- Database connection has to be set and fully functional.

- Users have to use a 16:9 pc monitor for the best experience but other aspect rations can be used too.

- Users have to be logged in in order to reach the profile page – guest users do not have a profile page, and only have limited permission to most of the possibilities (mostly only read, but no write.)

- Admins can add, they can delete or modify the items on the online bookstore.

- Admins can set discounts to certain books for limited time.
