_##Client report with the XYZ-books Kft. representatives

*Greeting, introduction between the client and the team members.*

**Client:** Our company has been dealing with book sales in Hungary since 2015, serving the claim of the bookworm community, with favorable prices, selling books in multiple languages. Our main problem is that we only have 2 shops in the country, in the capital Budapest and in Eger, and we want to expand, but for that we need to adapt to the customs of the 21st century. We would like to have a webshop. For now, only English language is sufficient but later selectable languages might be needed, that makes the process of buying a book more convenient to our customers. The webshop should be as user friendly as possible without any fancy animations and such. The customers shall have individual profile, making the shopping procedure even easier, as for the customers, who don’t want to have a profile, they should be able to do the shopping without having one.

**Board Team:** For this, we need a registration form and to store the data of the users. Could you please share some more information about your notions?

**Client:** As we said we would like the purchases to be independent from registration, so everyone should be able to shop on the page, and add products to the shopping cart. Although regular customers should have the opportunity to register, saving their username, email, full name, date of birth, gender, password in order to use it later for identification or any other use. After that, they will have to use only their username and password to log in. Also, we would like to make the customer's job even easier, and we would like to offer the possibility of saving shipping data and a billing address for registered users, so they can use that at the next order. They can also change it of course. Also, we would like to see when did the user register to our shop. The users should be able to use email and password combination to log in. Also, the user should be able to get his/her forgotten password if necessary. Of course, the customers should be able to browse our shop from every country, and also to order to and from any country.

**Board Team:** Sending the forgotten password back to the user is not really possible, because of the encryption process. We can do a reset password option instead. Also, you said that the users should be able to log in using their email and password, if we do that the user should be able to change their email, so we avoid later complications.

**Client:** Yes please do that. When it comes to registering orders into the webshop and the database, our workers should be able to register new products and modify existing products, also remove products form the shop, this should be done by the Secretary, we also need a Support user that can make orders for books, modify or delete orders, and can see and modify the customers data if something went wrong during the shopping process (for example the customer gave the wrong email). Also we need a Supervisor profile that has all of the privileges of the Secretary and the Support, and also can add Support or Secretary privileges to our workers, also to see what kind of products and when were they added by the others, and maybe some statistics about the sold books later in the future.

**Board Team:** That can be arranged. What about the books?

**Client:** Every book has a title, one or multiple authors, a publisher, a genre, a language, page number, an ISBN for international identification purposes, how many of that book we have in stock, or can be ordered and a price of said book. The customer has to be able to filter by the previously said tags, also filtering by price and page number should be done in an x-y interval and the page should list the products by about 30 pieces on each page. Also, since one book can have a multiple author, we need a system that doesn’t make a problem from this.

**Board Team:** All right, that greatly helps us designing the filter system. Now what about the webpage itself?

**Client:** We don’t want anything kitschy or silly design. We want a clean and easy to navigate site for convenient use. That being said the home page should welcome the customer by showing the 5 most popular books and the 5 newest books in separate carousels, and some random books. An “About Us” page where the company’s address and such information to be found. A shop page where the customer can browse and filter the products. A profile page where the registered customer can modify their data, as you said they should be able to modify their email too to avoid complications in the future. A shopping cart page where the customer can see the products, he/she placed to the cart listed by price and how many of that item is in the cart.  A page where our customers can send us messages. An “Our Shops” page with a map where our shops are in the country, with their address, phone number, and email address. A “Shipping and pricing” page, this will contain information about shipping and payment methods. About this we can’t say much yet, because we are still negotiating with shipping companies, but in the next meeting we can provide the content. Of course, we need a verification page too, where the customer can review the purchase details before confirming them.

**Board Team:** What about coupons and discounts?

**Client:** We don’t have anything planned for that, but later it would be a really good feature.

**Board Team:** So about orders and verification?

**Client:** Yes about those. On the order page the customer could choose if the customer is a private person or a company. If the customer chooses the shipping option there should be a form with the following things to add: Full name, Country, City, Street and house number, Postal Code, and a miscellaneous field (for Floor, room number, gate code etc.), and an extra field for other information (when the customer can take their orders and such). If the customer is a company then the following form should pop up: Company name, Tax number, Country, City, Address, Postal code, miscellaneous. 

**Board Team:** All right that is reasonable. Do you have anything specific about design? Like a specific color or shapes?

**Client:** No, we don’t, only that we would like our website to consist of light colors and clean design, the other stuff we leave to you.

**Board Team:** We see. We gladly accept the project. If you come up with any other ideas, feel free to message us. All of our members are eager to work together.
