## Current State

XYZ-Books Kft. is a relatively new bookstore chain with shops in Budapest and Eger. The company sells physical copies in multiple languages mainly Hungarian, English and German. As the customer base is growing rapidly it became harder and harder to complete orders in only these two locations over time. For this reason, XYZ-Books decided to expand to new cities and open a webshop, so customers can place orders on books from home.  As of now, the company has a website at XYZ-books.example.com, however, this site is a static website only containing basic contact information. Having a webshop would help the company keep in touch with customers, and help customers to purchase more easily and from a much wider inventory. That is why XYZ-Books Kft. contacted us.
